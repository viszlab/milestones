In response to the evolving demands of students campus buildings are increasingly re-structured to function as informal learning spaces. This research addresses the changing needs of students by investigating the transformation of campus buildings into informal learning spaces. Focused on the Lab42 building at UvA Science Park, the research explores the impact of integrating persuasive technology for optimal learning activities. By analyzing student behavior within the building and their interactions with a prototype design solution, the findings provide valuable insights for faculty staff, offering potential implications for the design of future university buildings..
