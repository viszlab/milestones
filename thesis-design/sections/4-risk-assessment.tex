\section{Risk Assessment}

Although this research is not entirely dependent on the available existing data, since part of the research is to gather data by the researcher, the results will most likely benefit from access and analyzing existing user and building datasets.

\subsection{Interview and surveys}

If no or not enough interviews can be conducted due to time constraints or unavailable interviewees, there will be a lack of information which leads to an absence of information saturation. 

\subsection{Building sensory data}

Access to data building is not properly exposed or current building data is limited to gather significant data about occupancy. Which means gathering data about the current building is limited. This can be mitagated by enhancing the already existing sensors with prototype sensing devices to gather data as a proof of concept.

\subsection{Installation}

Due to construction or administrative reasons it might not be possible to test the eventual design solution in the building at scale. This needs to be discussed with building faculty staff. This can be mitigated by testing the prototype in a different context to test it's usability.

\subsection{Ethical considerations}

Since most of this research involves user studies. The data requires the researcher
to act with great care, taking appropriate precautions the data is only examined on site within the constraints of the building and UvA faculty. Interacting with users within the building will be confirmed following the code of conduct for the HvA and an application to the ECIS about how data is being stored and gathered has been made. An advice from the committee is still pending.
