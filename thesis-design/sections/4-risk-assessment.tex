\section{Risk Assessment}

\subsection{Interview and surveys}

If no or not enough interviews can be conducted due to time constraints or unavailable interviewees, there will be a lack of information which leads to an absence of information saturation. 

\subsection{Building sensory data}

Access to data building is not property exposed. Which means gathering data about the current building is limited. This can be mitagated by enhancing the already existing sensors with prototype sensing devices to gather data as a proof of concept.

\subsection{Installation}

Due to construction or administrative reasons it might not be possible to test the eventual design solution in the building at scale. This needs to be discussed with building faculty staff. This can be mitigated by testing the prototype in a different context to test it's usability.
