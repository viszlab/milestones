\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
% Focus on what you add to the existing method. Explain what you will do and why (and how). Do not forget to characterize your research design. There should be an evaluation plan in this section. (For DS students, this normally means using manually labelled or ground truth data.)
Write about your methodology here. Focus on your own contribution. Indicate exactly how you will assess your work in terms of evaluation.
