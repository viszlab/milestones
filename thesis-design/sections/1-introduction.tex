\section{Introduction}
In response to the increase in student enrollments and their evolving needs, universities are transforming campus buildings into informal learning spaces to encourage students to spend more time on campus. This transformation is facilitated, in part, by the growing integration of sensors and automated systems within buildings. These technologies aim to regulate comfort in a multi-dimensional approach encapsulated in thermal, respiratory, visual, and acoustic dimensions.

However, the prevailing approach of retrofitting sensors onto existing buildings leaves students with a perceived lack of control and are often expected to conform to the building rather than experiencing spaces that adapt to their needs. This creates an interplay between students' needs and requirements, built environments, and computing technologies.

This thesis focuses on understanding user behavior and needs through in-the-wild studies and prototyping of various ubiquitous computing devices and the evaluation of their effectiveness with the overall goal of gathering insights into students' needs, to enhance their learning spaces and move towards adaptive smart buildings.

\subsection{Research questions}

In order to research the enhancement of informal learning spaces through ubiquitous computing:  the following main research question is formulated: \\

\emph{How can ubiquitous computing impact student behavior to significantly enhance the quality of informal learning spaces and facilitate an optimal learning environment?} \\

To effectively answer this main research question, this research is guided by the following supporting sub-questions that also serve as objectives to delineate the necessary knowledge: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} \emph{What are the characteristics, intentions, and goals of the students entering the building? }
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} \emph{How do students of the building currently define and rate their comfort concerning subjective parameters of the building? }
    \item \textbf{RQ3:} \emph{What sensory data about students and the environment is currently being collected and should this be enhanced? }
    \item \textbf{RQ4:} \emph{How can ubiquitous computing devices nudge students into certain desired behavior? }
    \item \textbf{RQ5:} \emph{Is there a difference in user behavior pre-installation and post-installation of the computing devices? }\\
\end{itemize}

As outlined in the \emph{related work} existing research has explored human-building interaction, the field of persuasive technology, data physicalization, and informal learning spaces. While research on defining comfort within indoor buildings and gathering and analyzing sensory data is prevalent, there is a gap in understanding user behavior and their subjective needs. Moreover, limited research exists on how design solutions can empower users, providing them with control and enabling spaces (including buildings in general) to adapt to user needs.

\subsection{Problem statement}

Modern campus buildings (e.g. Lab42) are increasingly equipped with sensors and automated systems to regulate occupants' comforts, governed by parameters established through generic building policies and faculty staff Unfortunately, students in these buildings often encounter limitations in exerting personal control over their comfort and data gathered by these systems is invisible to the user and choices the system makes are not transparent.

This adaptation implies that buildings should embody empathy \cite{empathic} and be adaptive (e.g. responsive to human signals such as emotions) with a focus on fostering user interaction with the environment. Researching to understand students' subjective needs, experiences, and behavior, coupled with a human-centric design approach, has the potential to elevate occupants' well-being and create optimal learning spaces. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights to faculty staff in making decisions to optimally arrange learning spaces and inform architecture and interior design studios on making decisions about structuring spaces and integrating computing technologies within built environments.

\subsection{Lab42 building}

This study will be conducted in association with the Digital Interactions Lab \footnote{https://uva-dilab.com/} and will utilize the recently opened Lab42 \footnote{https://lab42.uva.nl/} building at the UvA Amsterdam Science Park \footnote{https://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/} as its primary case study. Lab42 is an energy-neutral, flexible, and adaptable faculty building that facilitates collaborations among students, researchers, and businesses \cite{crouwel}. The buildings's layout is strategically organized into different zones, each serving various functions, ranging from quiet individual work to spaces that allow for collaborative work. The overarching interior theme in the design revolves around 'tech' and 'nature' aiming to cultivate a fresh, light, and warm comfortable ambiance. Sensing devices are installed throughout the building to automatically adjust lighting, air, and temperature \cite{faculty}.
