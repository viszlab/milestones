\section{Project Plan}

The master thesis project will be conducted on a part-time basis, initiated with concepting and ideation in November/December 2023. The main research phase will span from January 8, 2024, to June 30, 2024, concluding with thesis submission. The project's first phase involves gathering and analyzing user data. The subsequent phase focuses predominantly on prototyping design solutions and iterative refinement. The final phase includes usability testing and evaluation. For a detailed weekly overview, please refer to Figure 1. While the goal is for the research and design solutions to scale to other university buildings, the project's scope is limited to the Lab42 building due to uncertainties in the context of other buildings.
