\section{Project Plan}

The thesis project will be fulfilled on a part-time basis. This means that preperation for the project started already early november/december 2023 with concepting and ideation. From around the 8th of january 2024 until 30 june 2024 (submission data of the thesis) this research will be investigated.

The first phase of the project will focus on gathering user data and analysing. The second part of the project will mostly focus on prototyping design solutions and iterating. The third phase of the project will most likely consists of usability testing and evaluation. Please refer to figure 1 for a full weekly overview of task completion.

Ideally this research and the design solutions tested would scale to other university buildings but since the context of those buildings is unclear the scope of this research is defined to the Lab42 building.
