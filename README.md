# ![Milestones](docs/milestones_github_banner.png)

LaTeX for the milestone deliverables for feedback during the thesis project and any other relevant documents (e.g. ethics application, cost breakdown) used throughout the thesis project.

During the thesis project, it is mandatory to hand in 5 milestones of subsections of the paper and to give peer feedback to other students to pass for the thesis. If no submission is made for one or more of the milestones, the UvA supervisor will be advised to consider terminating the thesis.

## Install

These documents are written in VSCode using the LaTeX Workshop Extension. The `.vscode` folder sets up the configuration environment for the correct building of the references using this structure.

1) Install a code editor such as [VSCode](https://vscode.dev/).
2) Install the [LaTeX Workshop extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) for VSCode.
3) Clone this repository to your local machine.

```zsh
$ git clone git@github.com:viszlab/milestones.git
```
4. Open the `setup.tex` file in the relevant document folder and [build the output .pdf](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install#usage).
