  abstract = {Personal exposure to environmental substances is largely determined by time-microenvironment-activity patterns while moving across locations or microenvironments. Therefore, time-microenvironment-activity data are particularly useful in modeling exposure. We investigated determinants of workday time-microenvironment-activity patterns of the adult urban population in seven European cities. The EXPOLIS study assessed workday time-microenvironment-activity patterns among a total of 1427 subjects (age 19-60 years) in Helsinki (Finland), Athens (Greece), Basel (Switzerland), Grenoble (France), Milan (Italy), Prague (Czech Republic), and Oxford (UK). Subjects completed time-microenvironment-activity diaries during two working days. We present time spent indoors--at home, at work, and elsewhere, and time exposed to tobacco smoke indoors for all cities. The contribution of sociodemographic factors has been assessed using regression models. More than 90\% of the variance in indoor time-microenvironment-activity patterns originated from differences between and within subjects rather than between cities. The most common factors that were associated with indoor time-microenvironment-activity patterns, with similar contributions in all cities, were the specific work status, employment status, whether the participants were living alone, and whether the participants had children at home. Gender and season were associated with indoor time-microenvironment-activity patterns as well but the effects were rather heterogeneous across the seven cities. Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke differed substantially across these cities. The heterogeneity of these factors across cities may reflect city-specific characteristics but selection biases in the sampled local populations may also explain part of the findings. Determinants of time-microenvironment-activity patterns need to be taken into account in exposure assessment, epidemiological analyses, exposure simulations, as well as in the development of preventive strategies that focus on time-microenvironment-activity patterns that ultimately determine exposures.},

  abstract   = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2-year probability-based telephone survey ( n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63\% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87\% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6\% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},

Presently, a correlation between health and air pollution levels recorded in the past exists. The paper presents series of instruments concerning IAC (Indoor Air Quality) measurements and focuses on indoor air quality measurements taken in different closed spaces, as example. Based on the concentration values detected, the conclusion of the paper indicates that, depending on the technological process or activity in enclosed spaces, it is mandatory to check the IAQ. This action must be taken as prevention, in order to reduce potential health risks upon humans, acting in their homes, or schools and offices or industrial halls, in general in closed spaces, even when artificially ventilated.},

  abstract   = {Cognitive functions refer to the set of brain-based skills to execute tasks of various difficulty levels. As people spend substantial time indoors, the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) influences occupants’ cognitive functions and consequently their learning and work performance. Previous studies have commonly examined the effects of IEQ on integrated learning or work performance, rather than specific cognitive skills. The present review decomposes IEQ into five factors—indoor air quality, the thermal environment, lighting, noise, and non-light visual factors. It divided cognition into five categories—attention, perception, memory, language function, and higher order cognitive skills—to better understand the relationship between IEQ and cognition. We conducted a detailed manual review of 66 focused studies and adopted co-occurrence analysis to generate landscapes of the associations between IEQ and cognition factors by analyzing keywords and abstracts of 8133 studies. Overall, results show that poor IEQ conditions are but not always associated with reduced cognition. However, the effects of a specific IEQ factor on different cognitive functions are quite distinct. Likewise, a specific cognitive function could be affected by different IEQ factors to varying degrees. Furthermore, the results suggest extensive inconsistencies in the relevant literature, especially regarding the effects of IAQ or thermal environment on cognition. Additionally, the keyword co-occurrence analysis identified more IEQ factors and cognitive functions emerging in the recent literature. Future studies are recommended to explore the factors causing the inconsistencies that we highlight here.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to analyze the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) factors considering the influence of the occupants’ behaviors and the air change rate. For this, the real-time IEQ score was developed based on the indoor climate and air pollutant factors. This study was conducted from January to March at three offices, with the same room size but with different air change rates and used by people with different behavioral patterns. Three offices are based on a four-floor located in Seoul, South Korea, a monsoon climate region. The air change rate in Office \#1 varied from 33.89 to 37.66 m3/h, with a median of 35.77 m3/h, and it was higher than that in Office \#2 and \#3. As a result, the number of occupants could be related to the CO2 and TVOCs levels in all the offices. To keep the CO2 level within the low range (1000 ppm), the number of occupants should be 3 (density: 0.25 person/m2) or fewer, and to maintain the TVOCs level within the low range (400 μg/m3), it is necessary to enhance the air change rate to minimum 9.0 m3/h∙person by changing the ventilation methods according to ASHRAE 62–1. At the same time, as there is much more fine particulate coming from outside than inside, the filter can be used in the window to allow the fine particulate to be exported. The results can be used as a building management strategy that simultaneously enhances the thermal comfort and indoor air quality using a real-time IEQ score.},

We call this emerging area Human-Building Interaction (HBI) and introduce it as an interdisciplinary domain of research interfacing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with Architecture and Urban Design. HBI seeks to examine the involvement of HCI in studying and steering the evolution of built environments. Therefore, we need to ask foundational questions such as the following: what are the specific attributes of built environments that HCI researchers should take into account when shifting attention and scale from “artefacts” to “environments”? Are architecture and interaction design methods and processes compatible? Concretely, how can a team of interaction designers bring their tools to an architectural project, and collaborate with other stakeholders? Can and will architecture change the theory and practice of HCI? Furthermore, research in HBI should produce knowledge and practical guidelines by experimenting novel design instances that combine architecture and digital interaction. The primary aim of this article is to specify the mission, vision, and scope of research in HBI. As the introductory article to the TOCHI special issue, it also provides a summary of published manuscripts and describes their collective contribution to the development of this field.},

Most areas of computer science research, such as programming language implementation, distributed operating system design, or denotational semantics, are deﬁned largely by technical problems, and driven by building upon and elaborating a body of past results. Ubiquitous computing, by contrast, encompasses a wide range of disparate technological areas brought together by a focus upon a common vision. It is driven, then, not so much by the problems of the past but by the possibilities of the future. Ubiquitous computing’s vision, however, is over a decade old at this point, and we now inhabit the future imagined by its pioneers. The future, though, may not have worked out as the ﬁeld collectively imagined. In this article, we explore the vision that has driven the ubiquitous computing research agenda and the contemporary practice that has emerged. Drawing on crosscultural investigations of technology adoption, we argue for developing a ‘‘ubicomp of the present’’ which takes the messiness of everyday life as a central theme.},

In recent years, HCI, ubiquitous computing, and architecture have contributed to the interdisciplinary field of Human-Building Interaction (HBI). HBI represents the growing complexities of human experience within BE, which includes utilizing sensing capabilities to gracefully support people’s needs. We present an initial taxonomy classifying interactions with HBI devices, the HBI Interactivity Taxonomy, a novel contribution to this field. We employed an integrative research strategy, sampling device descriptions from commercial and academic sources. Taxonomy features were extracted through thematic analysis. The resulting list of characteristics describes how users interact with HBI devices. We offer an initial version of this taxonomy as a tool to facilitate communication and enhance the design and evaluation of future HBI devices in both academia and industry.},

Research and development however, rarely addresses occupants’ experiences and expectations in such environments, which is critical for designing ethical and occupant-centred workspaces. To support the design of human-centred smart buildings, a series of 4 workshops was conducted with a total of 27 participants, over 2 months, with occupants of a smart office building. Workshops used discursive (focus group) and projective (design fiction) techniques to qualitatively explore occupants’ perceptions of and concerns around the collection, processing and use of data within the building. Workshop data was thematically analysed, resulting in design implications for improving occupant experience in current smart workplaces, while also contributing implications for increasing the perceivability, accessibility and usability of data in such buildings. Contributing to discourses around Human-Building Interaction the paper concludes with discussion of future research challenges for occupant-centred development of quantified buildings.},

We studied space use in an office building following a method we have designed to reveal the occupancy rate and navigational patterns. Our method involves two key components: 1) a pervasive sensing system that is scalable for large buildings, and high number of occupants, and 2) participatory data analysis engaging stakeholders including interior architects and building performance engineers, to refine the questions and define the needs for further analyses through multiple iterations. In this paper, we describe our method in detail, and exemplify how HCI methods and approaches can contribute to professional building design projects.},

This body of knowledge can be drawn upon to shed light on the growing branch of HCI that pursues a shift from “artifact” to “environment” (and from “usability” to “comfort”). We contribute to this conceptual-contextual transition in three consecutive steps: (1) sketch the outline of comfort studies in the scholar field of Architecture and the ones in Human-Computer Interaction, (2) propose a schematic model of comfort that captures its interactive characteristics and, (3) demonstrate an interactive tool, called ComfortBox, that we prototyped to help answer some of the research questions about the perception of comfort in built environments.},

  abstract = {Human--building interaction (HBI) is converging the fields of architecture and interaction design, leading to new and interesting tensions in perspectives and methodological approaches. One such tension is related to temporal constraints. Architecture and interaction design typically produce outcomes with very different lifetime expectancies and, predominantly, use methods with very different pace. As an example, fast, iterative approaches of contemporary interaction design, consisting of frequent updates and redesigns, contrasts with much slower, plan-driven and long-term vision driven approaches within architecture. One question emerging from this tension is how to meaningfully combine perspectives and approaches. One suggestion, among others, has been that interaction design methods such as participatory design can be used to heighten the involvement of inhabitants and other stakeholders in continuous adaptations of the buildings they inhabit. While an interesting proposal, we believe that methodological considerations only partly address the complexity of the tension at play from the different lifetime expectancies of buildings and interactive computer systems. Unfolding this complexity further, we therefore propose a framework of temporal constraints at three levels of abstraction: (1) rationale, (2) method, and (3) outcome. Inspired by previous work, we discuss temporal constraints in HBI at these levels. We argue that designing for HBI requires an understanding of temporally constrained design conventions that apply meaningfully to both the short term and long term.},

This article aims to review published articles in this field, provide an overview of research trends, and examine the challenges and opportunities associated with HBI. Bibliometric analysis is used as an analytical method because it is less likely to make subjective judgments than conventional literature reviews. The 187 documents obtained will be analyzed for co-authorship, bibliographic coupling, citations, and co-occurrence to answer research questions. This research shows that the number of studies on human-building interactions has been steadily expanding, with a sharp increase since 2016. The current study also comprehensively examines the publication status of HBI-related articles, key research topics, and current trends and presents areas for future research. Furthermore, this study is a roadmap for future research focused on concepts related to HBI.},

  abstract = {This essay has three parts. In Part 1, I review six biases that frame the way architects and human–computer interaction (HCI) practitioners think about their design problems. These arise from differences between working on procedurally complex tasks in peripersonal space like writing or sketching and being immersed in larger physical spaces where we dwell and engage in body-sized activity like sitting, chatting, and moving about. In Part 2, I explore three types of interface: classical HCI, network interfaces such as context-aware systems, and socio-ecological interfaces. An interface for an architect is a niche that includes the very people who interact with it. In HCI, people are still distinct from the interface. Because of this difference, architectural conceptions may be a fertile playground for HCI. The same holds for interactivity. In Part 3, I discuss why interactivity in HCI is symmetric and transitive. Only in ecological and social interaction is it also reflexive. In ecological interfaces, people co-create bubbles of joint awareness where they share highly situated values, experience, and knowledge.},

We systematically explore the design space of interactive windows to chart requirements, constraints, and challenges. To that end, we built proof-of-concept prototypes of smart windows with fine-grained control of transparency. In two studies, we explored user attitudes towards interactive windows and elicited control methods. We found that users understand and see potential for interactive windows at home. We provide specific usage contexts and specify interactions that may facilitate domestic applications. Our work illustrates the concept of interactive smart windows and provides insights regarding their design, development, and user controls for adaptive walls. We identify design dimensions and challenges to stimulate further development in the domain of adaptive buildings.},

In this particular case, it was whether to take the stairs or the elevator in their place of work. The rationale was to push people towards a desired behavior at the point of decision-making and to reflect upon theirs and others' aggregate behavior. We describe the ambient displays that were developed and the prototyping studies in which they were evaluated. The findings from an in-the-wild study are then presented. They reveal that even though people said they were not aware of changing their behavior, logged data of their actual behavior showed a significant change. We discuss these mixed findings in relation to whether ambient displays can influence at an unconscious or conscious level.},

This paper discusses the evaluation of thermal comfort in a sample of higher educational buildings located in a hot arid climate like Egypt. It focuses on the use of three POE techniques to enhance interior conditions and emphasizes the importance of utilizing different techniques to verify findings. In the quest to achieve thermal comfort, POE techniques, whether quantitative or qualitative, are important tools for evaluation. A sample of indoor spaces is reviewed and indicates that 2/3 of them fulfill occupants satisfaction according to actual readings and simulation results. The research also involves a survey of POE questionnaires as an interactive tool for evaluation. This section reveals a different perspective by indicating that only 1/3 of spaces fulfill occupant satisfaction. The study highlights such a significant disparity in results and endorses that the operation of indoor spaces should provide favorable conditions which are actually perceived by users and are truly responsive to their needs.

This research paper re-examined the term ‘performance’ and its characterization in post-occupancy evaluation (POE) literature using a semi-systematic review of 160 articles published since 2008. The review identified how performance parameters have been defined, what the dominant attributes of studies are and what metrics have been used to measure them. A thematic content analysis found that many new priorities had emerged in recent years, problematizing Preiser et al.’s 1988 construct of the concept. The main contribution of this paper is a new expanded definition of ‘performance’ in terms of three interrelated domains: building, people and organization, and the development of subcategories for more nuanced analysis. This definition builds on the building performance-people performance paradigm first established by the UK’s PROBE initiative and responds to several shifts in thinking the review results revealed, including a shift from deterministic thinking towards a more bidirectional understanding of the person-environment relationship. Results were further distilled into recommendations to be used by researchers, practitioners and policymakers to identify performance areas of interest and develop more adaptive, integrated approaches to POE work.},

The major feature of SBS is that the effects experienced usually begin to disappear upon leaving the ‘sick’ environment. Although there is no controlling legislation for SBS, its effects have been documented, ‘Sick Building Syndrome’ appears in the Oxford English Dictionary, and recognised organisations, such as the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), have carried out extensive research on the syndrome. As SBS has no single specifi c cause, this paper seeks to identify the likely contributors, and uses a range of academic, medical, statistical and recognised organisational data to do so. The contributors include poor indoor air quality, excessive background noise, emissions from certain synthetic building and furnishing materials, inappropriate temperatures and airborne pollution. A link between SBS and inadequate levels of maintenance is suggested. This paper offers information to those engaged in the design and maintenance of buildings, while giving specifi c advice to both employers and employees, especially those who work in offi ce environments, to provide the reader with a better understanding and to highlight the measures that can be taken to reduce, if not eliminate, SBS.},

In a subset of studies that meet objective criteria for strength and consistency, pure CO2 at a concentration common in indoor environments was only found to affect high-level decision-making measured by the Strategic Management Simulation battery in non-specialized populations, while lower ventilation and accumulation of indoor pollutants, including CO2, could reduce the speed of various functions but leave accuracy unaffected. Major confounding factors include variations in cognitive assessment methods, study designs, individual and populational differences in subjects, and uncertainties in exposure doses. Accordingly, future research is suggested to adopt direct air delivery for precise control of CO2 inhalation, include brain imaging techniques to better understand the underlying mechanisms that link CO2 and cognitive function, and explore the potential interaction between CO2 and other environmental stimuli.},

  abstract   = {This paper introduces a Human and Building Interaction Toolkit (HABIT) for simulating the thermally adaptive behaviors and comfort of office occupants alongside building energy consumption. The toolkit uses the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) to co-simulate a field-tested, agent-based behavior model with an EnergyPlus medium office model. The usefulness of the toolkit is demonstrated through a series of zone and building-level case study simulations that examine the wisdom of pairing local heating and cooling options with strategic thermostat set point offsets, judging from the energy, Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ), and cost perspectives. Results generally suggest that trading efficient local heating/cooling options for whole space conditioning has both energy and comfort benefits, saving up to 28\% of monthly HVAC energy while improving the acceptability of thermal conditions in a Philadelphia climate. Nevertheless, cost analysis shows that the fuel source of conserved energy must be considered – particularly in the case of personal heater use, which adds to electric plug loads and associated utility and CO2 emissions cost penalties. Moreover, costs from even small changes in simulated occupant productivity tend to overwhelm energy costs, suggesting the need to improve the accuracy and precision of available productivity models across multiple seasons and climates.},

Compared to data visualization, there is no established vocabulary for analyzing and discussing the properties of physicalizations. Through a grounded analysis of examples and literature, we propose a comprehensive design vocabulary, which consist of three separate, but connected parts: explicit variables, implicit properties, and consequential aspects. Explicit variables build on visual variables known from visualization and extend it to account for physicalization’s multi-modal nature. Implicit properties concern elements which are central to the design intention and user experience of physicalizations, yet are not a result of “explicit” encoding strategies. Finally, consequential aspects refer to unintentional effects of design decisions, that influence how a physicalization is experienced. Our work illustrates how physicalizations incorporate opportunities and challenges that are not afforded in other data representations, such as embodiment and imagined touch. With this, we contribute to generating theory on physicalization. Our design vocabulary can support (1) creators through informing their design processes and highlighting design strategies, (2) educators, and (3) academics and practitioners to analyse existing physicalizations, and reflect on the impact of design decisions on interpretation and experience.},

As an emerging area, Data physicalisation research needs conceptual foundations to support thinking about and designing new physical representations of data and evaluating them. Yet, it remains unclear at the moment (i) what encoding variables are at the designer’s disposal during the creation of physicalisations, (ii) what evaluation criteria could be useful, and (iii) what methods can be used to evaluate physicalisations. This article addresses these three questions through a narrative review and a systematic review. The narrative review draws on the literature from Information Visualisation, HCI and Cartography to provide a holistic view of encoding variables for data. The systematic review looks closely into the evaluation criteria and methods that can be used to evaluate data physicalisations. Both reviews offer a conceptual framework for researchers and designers interested in designing and evaluating data physicalisations. The framework can be used as a common vocabulary to describe physicalisations and to identify design opportunities. We also proposed a seven-stage model for designing and evaluating physical data representations. The model can be used to guide the design of physicalisations and ideate along the stages identified. The evaluation criteria and methods extracted during the work can inform the assessment of existing and future data physicalisation artefacts.},

In this article, we examine how “physicalization” is part of a broader ecology—the “physecology”—with properties that go beyond the scope of the working definition. Through analyzing 60 representative physicalization papers, we derived six design dimensions of a physecology: (i) represented data type, (ii) way of information communication, (iii) interaction mechanisms, (iv) spatial input–output coupling, (v) physical setup, and (vi) audiences involved. Our contribution is the extension of the definition of physicalization to the broader concept of “physecology,” to provide conceptual clarity on the design of physicalizations for future work.},

To bridge these communities synergistically, we present a design space that describes and analyzes physicalizations according to three facets: context (end-user considerations), structure (the physical structure of the artifact), and interactions (interactions with both the artifact and data). We construct this design space through a systematic review of 47 physicalizations and analyze the interrelationships of key factors when designing a physicalization. This design space cross-pollinates knowledge from relevant HCI communities, providing a cohesive overview of what designers should consider when creating a data physicalization while suggesting new design possibilities.

Concurrently, unparalleled datasets are generated through Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensing implemented at urban, building, and personal scales that serve as a potential tool for understanding and overcoming these issues. Focusing on air pollution and thermal exposure challenges in cities, we reviewed and summarized the literature on IoT environmental sensing on urban, building, and human scales, presenting the first integrated assessment of IoT solutions from the data convergence perspective on all three scales. We identified that there is a lack of guidance on what to measure, where to measure, how frequently to measure, and standards for the acceptable measurement quality on all scales of application. The current literature review identified a significant disconnect between applications on each scale. Currently, the research primarily considers urban, building, and personal scale in isolation, leading to significant data underutilization. We addressed the scientific and technological challenges and opportunities related to data convergence across scales and detailed future directions of IoT sensing along with short- and long-term research and engineering needs. IoT application on a personal scale and integration of information on all scales opens up the possibility of developing personal thermal comfort and exposure models. The development of personal models is a vital promising area that offers significant advancements in understanding the relationship between environment and people that requires significant further research.},

  abstract = {Building occupants find it difficult to achieve the optimal indoor environment quality (IEQ) through natural ventilation. To solve this problem, this study aimed to develop an automatic ventilation control algorithm considering the IEQ factors and occupant ventilation behavior. The algorithm was developed in four steps: (i) real-time collection of data on the IEQ factors and occupant ventilation behavior; (ii) development of the automatic ventilation control algorithm using logistic regression; (iii) determination of the automatic ventilation control algorithm using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis; and (iv) evaluation of the automatic ventilation control algorithm's performance according to the indoor environmental standards. Through this process, the logistic regression model with ridge regression (area under curve: 0.865), with the highest classification accuracy, was selected. Then Youden's index was used to define the decision criterion (i.e., optimal cutoff value) for the logistic regression model. As a result, the decision criterion for opening and closing the windows or doors was 0.533. When the developed algorithm was compared with the indoor environmental standards to analyze its performance, the compliance rate of the opening of the windows or doors based on the monitored data was 77.6\%, but it increased to 99\% based on the data classified by the developed algorithm. It is expected that if the automatic ventilation control algorithm is embedded in a building ventilation system, which is connected to various IEQ measurement sensors, it will offer a customized building ventilation system to the building occupants.},

  abstract  = {Repeated exposure to poor air quality in indoor environments such as office, home, and classroom can have substantial adverse effects on our health and productivity. The problem is especially recognized in closed indoor spaces shared by several people. We have studied the evolution of carbon dioxide level in office-meeting spaces, during 1007 meeting sessions. The collected data is employed to examine machine learning models aimed to indicate the CO2 evolution pattern and to forecast when fresh air should be supplied. In addition, to gain insight into the relations and interdependencies of social factors in meetings that may influence the users’ perception of an interactive solution, we have conducted a series of online surveys. Building on the results of the two studies, a solution is proposed that predicts the evolution of air quality in naturally-ventilated meeting rooms and engages the users in preventive actions when risk is forecast.},

  abstract  = {For years the HCI community has struggled to integrate design in research and practice. While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within HCI. Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.},

But can physical visualizations help carry out actual information visualization tasks? We present the ﬁrst infovis study comparing physical to on-screen visualizations. We focus on 3D visualizations, as these are common among physical visualizations but known to be problematic on computers. Taking 3D bar charts as an example, we show that moving visualizations to the physical world can improve users’ efﬁciency at information retrieval tasks. In contrast, augmenting on-screen visualizations with stereoscopic rendering alone or with prop-based manipulation was of limited help. The efﬁciency of physical visualizations seems to stem from features that are unique to physical objects, such as their ability to be touched and their perfect visual realism. These ﬁndings provide empirical motivation for current research on fast digital fabrication and self-reconﬁguring interfaces.},

We conducted a user study with 40 participants in which we measured the recall of three types of information immediately after exploration and with a delay of two weeks. The results show that the physical visualization led to significantly less information decay within this time span.

  abstract   = {Background:
                Grounded theory is a well-known methodology employed in many research studies. Qualitative and quantitative data generation techniques can be used in a grounded theory study. Grounded theory sets out to discover or construct theory from data, systematically obtained and analysed using comparative analysis. While grounded theory is inherently flexible, it is a complex methodology. Thus, novice researchers strive to understand the discourse and the practical application of grounded theory concepts and processes.
                
                Objective:
                The aim of this article is to provide a contemporary research framework suitable to inform a grounded theory study.
                
                Result:
                This article provides an overview of grounded theory illustrated through a graphic representation of the processes and methods employed in conducting research using this methodology. The framework is presented as a diagrammatic representation of a research design and acts as a visual guide for the novice grounded theory researcher.
                
                Discussion:
                As grounded theory is not a linear process, the framework illustrates the interplay between the essential grounded theory methods and iterative and comparative actions involved. Each of the essential methods and processes that underpin grounded theory are defined in this article.
                
                Conclusion:
                Rather than an engagement in philosophical discussion or a debate of the different genres that can be used in grounded theory, this article illustrates how a framework for a research study design can be used to guide and inform the novice nurse researcher undertaking a study using grounded theory. Research findings and recommendations can contribute to policy or knowledge development, service provision and can reform thinking to initiate change in the substantive area of inquiry.},

  abstract   = {With the swift growth in commerce and transportation in the modern civilization, much attention has been paid to air quality monitoring, however existing monitoring systems are unable to provide sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions of the data with cost efficient and real time solutions. In this paper we have investigated the issues, infrastructure, computational complexity, and procedures of designing and implementing real-time air quality monitoring systems. To daze the defects of the existing monitoring systems and to decrease the overall cost, this paper devised a novel approach to implement the air quality monitoring system, employing the edge-computing based Internet-of-Things (IoT). In the proposed method, sensors gather the air quality data in real time and transmit it to the edge computing device that performs necessary processing and analysis. The complete infrastructure \& prototype for evaluation is developed over the Arduino board and IBM Watson IoT platform. Our model is structured in such a way that it reduces the computational burden over sensing nodes (reduced to 70\%) that is battery powered and balanced it with edge computing device that has its local data base and can be powered up directly as it is deployed indoor. Algorithms were employed to avoid temporary errors in low cost sensor, and to manage cross sensitivity problems. Automatic calibration is set up to ensure the accuracy of the sensors reporting, hence achieving data accuracy around 75–80\% under different circumstances. In addition, a data transmission strategy is applied to minimize the redundant network traffic and power consumption. Our model acquires a power consumption reduction up to 23\% with a significant low cost. Experimental evaluations were performed under different scenarios to validate the system’s effectiveness.},

  abstract   = {How can you design technology that becomes a part of a user’s life and not a distraction from it? This practical book explores the concept of calm technology, a method for smoothly capturing a user’s attention only when necessary, while calmly remaining in the background most of the time. You’ll learn how to design products that work well, launch well, are easy to support, easy to use, and remain unobtrusive.  Author Amber Case presents ideas first introduced by researchers at Xerox PARC in 1995, and explains how they apply to our current technology landscape, especially the Internet of Things. This book is ideal for UX and product designers, managers, creative directors, and developers. You’ll learn: The importance and challenge of designing technology that respects our attention Principles of calm design―peripheral attention, context, and ambient awareness Calm communication patterns―improving attention through a variety of senses Exercises for improving existing products through calm technology Principles and patterns of calm technology for companies and teams The origins of calm technology at Xerox PARC},

  abstract = {Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},
